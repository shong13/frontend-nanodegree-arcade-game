Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

## Instructions

Open index.html to be taken to the game. The game will automatically start. Move the character using the arrow keys. Avoid the beetles and try to get to the river on the other side! If you collide with a beetle, you lose the game, but if you can avoid all the beetles and get to the river, you win!

## Bugs 

There are no known bugs as of now. However, other features to make the game more interesting will be implemented in the future.
